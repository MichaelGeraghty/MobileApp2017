# MobileApp2017
Universal windows 10 project for Mobile apps module. Soundboard for Dota 2 an online competitive game Using popular casters
and personalities for the soundboard.

Once the App is started you are presented with the main menu where you have a choice between 5(current) sound categories that will navigate you to that specific category. Under each category you are presented with a page of buttons once clicked play the corresponding sound. There is no auto stop currently because I wanted to allow for seemless transition between clips. Clicking the hardware back button or the provided back(if the user has no hardware back button) button will stop sound depending on the system you are using.

Under the last category at the bottom of the menu "Thanks for trying this app" there is a section demonstrating some basic isolated storage. The example is from the coverage of the last International where after every analysis a satirical "Thanks Purge" was either commentated on by other members of the panel or typed by the thousands of viewers. So the message is default thanks purge but can be changed by the user to display another message that will be saved and can be displayed everytime they open the app.
